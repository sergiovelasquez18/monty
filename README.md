![monty](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CFYYWy6UEAE9Ow-.png)

## Description
_In this project we are tasked to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCode files. These files will have commands per line to manipulate the data structure given._

What you should learn from this project:

* What do LIFO and FIFO mean
* What is a stack, and when to use it
* What is a queue, and when to use it
* What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
* What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
* What is the proper way to use global variables
* How to work with git submodules

---
## Resources

	* Google
	* How do I use extern to share variables between source files in C?
	* Working with submodules

---
## Instructions

Compile with:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty
```
---

## Example
<pre><code>julien@ubuntu:~/0x18. Stack (LIFO) &amp; queue (FIFO)$ cat -e bytecodes/000.m
push 0$
push 1$
push 2$
  push 3$
                   pall    $
push 4$
    push 5    $
      push    6        $
pall$
julien@ubuntu:~/0x18. Stack (LIFO) &amp; queue (FIFO)$
</code></pre>

## Requirements
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You allowed to use a maximum of one global variable
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are allowed to use the C standard library
- The repository monty should be added as a submodule to your holbertonschool-low_level_programming repository, under the name 0x18-stacks_queues_lifo_fifo

## Tasks

### 0. push, pall
* Implement the push and pall opcodes.
* The opcode push pushes an element to the stack.
* The opcode pall prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack.

### 1. pint
* Implement the pint opcode.
* The opcode pint prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

### 2. pop
* Implement the pop opcode.
* The opcode pop removes the top element of the stack.

### 3. swap
* Implement the swap opcode
* The opcode swap swaps the top two elements of the stack.

### 4. add
* Implement the add opcode.
* The opcode add adds the top two elements of the stack.

### 5. nop
* Implement the nop opcode.
* The opcode nop doesnâ€™t do anything.

### Advanced Tasks
* opcodes: sub, div, mul, mod, comments, pchar, pstr, rotl, rotr, stack, queue, Holberton, Add two digits, Multiplication, Multiplication level up
